## :beginner: Subject

We were commissioned by a fictitious company selling models and scale models.
The company already has a database that lists employees, products, orders and much more.
The director wishes to have a dashboard which he could refresh daily to have the latest information in order to manage the company.


## :dart: Product Backlogs

The dashboard revolves around these 4 main topics : 
- **Sales** : number of products sold by category and by month, compared to the sales of the same month of the previous year.
- **Finances** : turnover of the orders of the last two months by country and orders that have not yet been paid.
- **Logistics** : stocks of the products that need to be supplied.
- **Human Resources** : Each month, the two sellers with the highest turnover.
